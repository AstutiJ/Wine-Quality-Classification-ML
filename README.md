# Wine Quality Classification using Machine Learning 🍷

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine using machine learning techniques.  
It was developed as part of the **Edunet Foundation program** using Python and Scikit-Learn.

The goal of the project is to build a classification model that can accurately classify wine quality based on various physicochemical properties.

## Project Overview

- Dataset contains physicochemical attributes of wine such as acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol, etc.
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis were performed.
- Class imbalance was handled using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**.
- Machine learning models were trained and evaluated using Scikit-Learn.
